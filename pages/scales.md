 Standardised scales
</h1>
<p>
 Standardised scales (often interchangeably referred to as summated scales or
 validated instruments) are a collection of related questions that measure an
 underlying concept. Below is a list of some of the scales used by the CLOSER partner studies. </p>
<p>
View the individual pages linked below to see the questions in each scale and their use by the CLOSER Discovery studies. 
</p>
<p>
 The names of the standardised scales in this table, and on the scales' individual pages, are the original versions. The individual pages of the standardised scales may also contain versions that stem from the original scale.
</p>
<p>
 This is a work in progress, we will continue to add more scales to CLOSER Discovery, with links to the study questionnaires that use them. These
 standardised scales were chosen because they are frequently used by the CLOSER Discovery studies and in the wider community. If you know of any inaccuracies, additional questionnaires which use these scales, or scales which are not on this list
 which were used, please contact us at closer@ucl.ac.uk.
